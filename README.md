Components Playground
=====================

This repository is meant to be a set of play scripts to see how the symfony component works in isolation.

Most of the code can be executed from your command line

    > php ComponentName/example{i}.php

Feel free to append new examples to this repository, but one important thing, keep in mind that every example
has to keep easy and stress only one feature of the component.

I decided to create this repository after reading this blog post
http://fabien.potencier.org/article/49/what-is-symfony2
and most of the code and ideas here is just copied and pasted from there.
